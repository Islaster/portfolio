        Hello, my name is Isaac and I'm a Full-Stack Developer - I enjoy
        building the logic behind websites and mobile apps as well as
        implementing databases in my code. However, I didn't always start off
        this way 3 years ago, I was a server who just started his journey on the
        path to web development. When I wasn't catering to the needs of my
        guests, I was teaching myself. First, I started with client-side skills
        such as <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, &{" "}
        <strong>JavaScript</strong> as well as frameworks and web packs. As my
        interest grew so did the versatility and diversity of my skills.
        Eventually, I found and learned some server-side skills such as{" "}
        <strong>Node.js</strong> and <strong>MongoDB</strong> as my self-study
        but I was starting to hit a wall so I applied to{" "}
        <strong>General Assembly</strong>. The 3 months I spent with the team, I
        found a way to increase and also connect both my server and client-side
        skillsets as well as learning others like <strong>Python</strong>,{" "}
        <strong>PostgreSQL</strong> and <strong>React.js</strong>. My new goals
        are maintaining and improving upon the functionality of my websites as
        well as obtaining new opportunities and growing connections with
        like-minded individuals in tech.
