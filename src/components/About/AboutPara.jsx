        Hello, my name is Isaac and I'm a Full-Stack Developer - I enjoy
        building the logic behind websites and mobile apps as well as
        implementing databases in my code. However, I didn't always start off
        this way. 3 years ago, I was a server who just started his journey on
        the path to web development. When I wasn't catering to the needs of my
        guests, I was teaching myself first I started with client-side skills
        such as <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, &{" "}
        <strong>JavaScript</strong> as well as frameworks and webpacks. As my
        interest grew so did the versatility and diversity of my skills,
        eventually I found and learned some server-side skills such as{" "}
        <strong>Node.js</strong> and <strong>MongoDB</strong> as my self-study
        was starting to hit a wall i applied to{" "}
        <strong>General Assembly</strong> to get pass my internal wall. the 3
        months i spent with the team their i found a way to not only get pass
        the wall but also how to connect both my server and client side
        skillsets as well as learn a cpl more skill server side lanuage. My new
        goals are maintaining and improving upon the functionality of my
        websites as well as taking qualities from other opportunities in tech.
